# Reimbursement Matching Implementation Summary

## GitHub Issue #1: Match Reimbursements

This implementation addresses the requirement to identify and match reimbursable expenses with their corresponding reimbursement deposits, particularly for healthcare and work-related expenses.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Transaction Model
- Added `reimbursed` field to track if an expense has been reimbursed
- Added `reimbursementId` field to link expenses to their reimbursement transactions
- Added `originalCurrency` and `exchangeRate` fields for foreign currency transactions

### 2. Reimbursement Matching Service
- **Automatic matching algorithm** that identifies potential reimbursements based on:
  - Transaction amounts (with configurable tolerance)
  - Date proximity (configurable max days difference)
  - Category patterns (healthcare, work travel, etc.)
  - Description keywords (HSA, reimbursement, etc.)

- **Currency conversion support** using exchange rate API
- **AI-enhanced matching** using Azure OpenAI for complex cases
- **Manual matching capabilities** for edge cases

### 3. Currency Exchange Service
- Real-time exchange rates from exchangerate-api.com
- Caching mechanism to reduce API calls
- Support for common international currencies
- Automatic conversion for reimbursement matching

### 4. User Interface Enhancements
- **"Find Reimbursements" button** to trigger matching process
- **Reimbursement panel** showing potential matches with confidence scores
- **Visual indicators** for reimbursed transactions (crossed out amounts)
- **Toggle to show/hide reimbursed transactions** in spending calculations
- **Apply/Reject match controls** for user verification

### 5. Spending Calculation Improvements
- Option to exclude reimbursed expenses from spending totals
- Maintains accurate financial reporting by not double-counting reimbursed expenses
- Preserves original transaction data for audit purposes

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified/Created:
1. **`src/types/index.ts`** - Added reimbursement-related interfaces
2. **`src/services/currencyExchangeService.ts`** - New service for exchange rates
3. **`src/services/reimbursementMatchingService.ts`** - Core matching logic
4. **`src/hooks/useReimbursementMatching.ts`** - React hook for UI integration
5. **`src/components/Transactions/Transactions.tsx`** - Enhanced UI with reimbursement features
6. **`src/data/defaultCategories.ts`** - Added business travel subcategory

### Matching Algorithm:
1. **Phase 1: Exact/Approximate matches** - Direct amount and date correlation
2. **Phase 2: Currency conversion** - Handles international transactions
3. **Phase 3: AI matching** - Complex pattern recognition for partial reimbursements
4. **Manual override** - User can create manual matches

### Sample Data:
Added realistic test transactions including:
- Healthcare expenses with HSA reimbursements
- Business travel with company reimbursements
- International transactions with currency conversion

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Matching:
- CVS Pharmacy expense ($245.75) → HSA Reimbursement ($245.75)
- United Airlines business travel ($550.00) → Company expense reimbursement ($550.00)
- London hotel in GBP → USD reimbursement with currency conversion

### Features for Complex Cases:
- **Multiple expenses, single reimbursement**: AI can identify patterns
- **Currency differences**: Automatic conversion and tolerance matching
- **Partial reimbursements**: Handles cases where not all expenses are reimbursed
- **Time gaps**: Configurable tolerance for reimbursement timing

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk reimbursement processing** for large datasets
2. **Machine learning** to improve matching accuracy over time
3. **Integration with accounting systems** for automated reimbursement workflows
4. **Mobile-responsive** reimbursement management
5. **Notification system** for pending reimbursements

## Benefits

- **Accurate spending tracking** by excluding reimbursed expenses
- **Automated workflow** reducing manual transaction categorization
- **International support** with currency conversion
- **Audit trail** maintaining complete transaction history
- **User control** with manual override capabilities

This implementation successfully addresses the GitHub issue requirements while providing a robust, scalable foundation for reimbursement management in the Mo Money application.
